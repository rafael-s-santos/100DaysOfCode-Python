Hello, everyone,

I'm very excited to share with you my learning journey in the [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp] by [Angela Yu]. This is a space where I'll document my progress, challenges, and achievements as I dive into the exciting world of Python coding.

## ✔️ What Will I Learn?

🔲 **App and Website Development:** I will explore building complete web applications and websites using Python and **Flask**, along with other modern technologies.

🔲 **Crucial Tools:** I'll also get closer to important tools like **Selenium**, **Beautiful Soup**, **Requests**, and more.

🔲 **Automation:** I've been using Python to automate some repetitive work tasks since the beginning of the year, but there's always more to learn.

🔲 **Data Science and Machine Learning:** It's not my current focus, but I believe it's essential to know some libraries like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Scikit Learn**, **Plotly**, and **Matplotlib**.

## ✔️ Why?

🔲 **Professional Dev:** My goal is to become a professional developer, even starting from scratch.

🔲 **Fun and Challenge:** I'm sure I'll learn in a fun and challenging way by building exciting projects.

🔲 **Engaged Community:** I'll be part of an active learning community, sharing my progress and getting support from my peers.

The projects that interest me the most will also be posted in their own repositories.
This is my chance to explore the fascinating world of programming!

**Let's code!**
